## 📖 Detailed Setup Options

### Using Doppler (Production Secret Management)

Doppler provides secure, centralized secret management:

   ```bash
# Install Doppler CLI
brew install doppler  # or see https://docs.doppler.com/docs/install-cli

# Login and setup
doppler login
doppler setup

# Run with Doppler
pnpm run dev:all:doppler
```

**Doppler configuration**:

```bash
# Backend variables
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key
   PORT=3001
   FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000

# Frontend variables (must be VITE_ prefixed)
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Langfuse (optional)
   LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
   LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
   LANGFUSE_BASE_URL=https://cloud.langfuse.com
   ```

### Running Services Separately
   
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Backend
   pnpm run dev:server
   
   # Terminal 2: Frontend
   pnpm run dev
   ```

## 📋 How It Works

1. **Upload your TfL statements** (CSV, PDF, or images)
2. **Select the days you worked** using the interactive calendar
3. **Get your total** - the AI calculates your reimbursement instantly
4. **Export the summary** for your finance team

The AI agent intelligently:
- Extracts journey data from multiple formats
- Matches journeys to your work days
- Handles multiple invoices across different months
- Validates and merges data automatically

## 🔍 AI Observability with Langfuse

This project showcases **production-grade AI monitoring** using Langfuse:

### What's Tracked
- ✅ **Complete workflow traces** - See the entire expense calculation process
- ✅ **AI model calls** - Full Gemini API request/response details
- ✅ **Performance metrics** - Latency, token usage, and estimated costs
- ✅ **Error tracking** - Automatic capture of failures
- ✅ **Session grouping** - Group related operations for debugging

### Setup (Optional but Recommended)
1. Sign up for free at [cloud.langfuse.com](https://cloud.langfuse.com)
2. Get your API keys from the dashboard
3. Add them to your `.env` file
4. View traces in real-time as you use the app

The app works perfectly fine without Langfuse, but you'll miss out on the powerful observability features that make debugging AI systems a breeze.

## 🔒 Security Architecture

This project implements **enterprise-grade security** for API key protection:

✅ **Backend Proxy Pattern**: All AI requests go through a secure server  
✅ **Zero Client Exposure**: API keys never touch the browser  
✅ **CORS Protection**: Only configured origins can access the API  
✅ **Rate Limiting**: 30 requests/minute per IP to prevent abuse  
✅ **Production Ready**: Designed for HTTPS deployment  

**Health Check**: Visit `http://localhost:3001/health` to verify the backend is running.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Failed to fetch" or "Cannot connect to backend"

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure backend is running: `pnpm run dev:server`
2. Check `http://localhost:3001/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`
3. Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
4. Confirm ports 3000 and 3001 are available

**Issue**: "Invalid API key" error

**Solutions**:
1. Get a valid key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Ensure no extra spaces in your `.env` file
3. Restart the backend server after updating the key
